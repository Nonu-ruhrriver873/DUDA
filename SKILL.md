  DUDA — Isolation guardian skill for Claude Code. Prevents, diagnoses, and recovers
  isolation contamination in multi-layered architectures: multi-tenant SaaS,
  platform-derivative hierarchies, monorepo app boundaries, and microservice boundaries.
  Blocks execution below 95-point trust score and provides remediation paths.

  [INIT mode] Triggered by "duda init" or when DUDA_MAP.md is missing.
  Runs scripts/init.py to explore the project via topological sort and generate DUDA_MAP.md.

  [TRANSPLANT mode] Triggered when migration keywords ("migrate", "port", "copy from",
  "bring over", "use X in Y", "apply X to Y") are detected alongside file/layer/path references.
  Runs scripts/analyze.py → scripts/trust.py to measure trust, then executes strategy
  only when score >= 95.

  [AUDIT mode] Triggered by contamination keywords ("data leak", "wrong tenant",
  "showing other", "contamination", "why is X visible", "broken isolation").
  Runs scripts/audit.py to trace contamination paths and determine root cause.

  [SCAN mode] Lightweight mode: "duda scan <path>" for quick single-file/directory
  analysis without requiring DUDA_MAP. Outputs layer tag, risk assessment, import analysis.

  Explicitly invocable via "duda" or "DUDA" keywords.
  Applies to all isolation architectures: platform→derivative hierarchies,
  B2B SaaS multi-tenant, monorepo app boundaries, and microservice boundaries.

# DUDA — Isolation Guardian Skill

> Moles appear separate above ground, but underground they're all connected by tunnels.
> A transplant request is executed only after mapping the entire tunnel system.
> Execution is blocked below a 95-point trust score.

## Step 0 — Always First (Common to All Modes)

```bash
# 1. Check map state
ls DUDA_MAP.md 2>/dev/null && python scripts/trust.py --check-map || echo "MAP_MISSING"

# 2. Memory recall — check experience first (may skip analysis)
python scripts/memory.py recall --mode [mode] --source [path] --target [path]
```

- MAP_MISSING → auto-enter **INIT mode**
- Trust LOW → recommend `duda update` to user, then continue or abort
- Trust MEDIUM+ → proceed with current mode

**Memory Recall Interpretation:**

| Confidence | Meaning | Action |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| `CERTAIN` (5+ hits) | Same pattern confirmed 5+ times | Skip analysis, execute cached strategy immediately |
| `HIGH` (3+ hits) | High-confidence experience exists | Skip analysis, apply cached strategy |
| `MEDIUM` (2 hits) | Experience exists, needs verification | Quick analysis + compare with cache |
| `LOW` (1 hit) | Single prior experience | Full analysis, reference previous result |
| `UNKNOWN` | First encounter | Full analysis required |

When CERTAIN/HIGH, skip analysis steps and apply the cached strategy directly.
After every operation, record results to memory for future acceleration.

---

## INIT Mode

### When
- `duda init` or `duda initialize` command
- DUDA_MAP.md does not exist (auto-trigger)
- `duda update` command (regenerate map)

### Execution

```bash
python scripts/init.py --root . --mode [solo|team]
```

**What init.py does — Topological Flood Fill:**

```
1. Collect leaf files (files that import nothing from the project)
   → packages/shared-types, utils, constants, etc.

2. Topological Sort
   → Traverse from leaves upward sequentially
   → Skip already-tagged nodes (no duplicates)
   → Repeat until all nodes are tagged (no gaps)

3. Assign layer tags to each file
   [UPPER-ONLY ✓] — imports upper-only paths or contains upper-only identifiers
   [SHARED ✓]     — imports nothing layer-specific, or packages/ only
   [SHARED ?]     — ambiguous — collect grep evidence, then re-judge
   [LAYER:X]      — confirmed as specific layer only

4. Generate DUDA_MAP.md
5. Register boundary file checksums
6. Request user approval → approval confirms trust HIGH
```

**INIT Completion Output:**
```
✅ DUDA_MAP generated

Isolation types:  Type A + Type B
Hierarchy:        Platform > Organization > Tenant > Store
Files tagged:     347 complete / 12 ambiguous (manual review needed)
Boundary files:   8 checksums registered
Transplant deny:  4-tier BOM management, cost master data

Does this structure look correct? (Y / enter corrections)
```

Map is not used until approved.

---

## SCAN Mode (Lite — No Map Required)

### When
- `duda scan <path>` command
- Quick check without full INIT
- "Is this file safe to import in my tenant layer?"

### Execution

```bash
python scripts/analyze.py --source <path> --lite
```

**What SCAN does:**
```
1. Analyze all imports in the target file/directory
2. Check for upper-only identifiers (admin, system, platform keywords)
3. Detect tenant identifier presence in DB queries
4. Flag dynamic imports as [UNVERIFIABLE]
5. Output quick risk assessment
```

**SCAN Output:**
```
🔍 DUDA SCAN — src/components/MenuCard.tsx

Imports:     5 total
  [SHARED]         3  (react, next/image, @/lib/utils)
  [UPPER-ONLY]     1  (from @/platform/stores/rawCostStore)
  [NEEDS-ADAPTER]  1  (from @/platform/hooks/useMenu)

Risk Level:  🟡 MEDIUM — upper-only dependency detected
Suggestion:  Cannot import directly. Use adapter pattern (Strategy 2).
```

---

## TRANSPLANT Mode

> **Principle: Not a single line of code is touched until trust score reaches 95.**

### Phase 0 — Intent Confirmation

When keywords are detected, do NOT execute immediately. Confirm first:
```
🦔 DUDA TRANSPLANT detected — "[original user message]"
Is this a migration/transplant operation? (Y / N)
```
N → exit. Y → proceed.

### Phase 1 — Pre-contamination Check at Destination

```bash
python scripts/audit.py --target [destination_path] --quick
```

If contamination found:
```
🔴 Existing contamination detected at destination
Recommend running AUDIT first, then TRANSPLANT.
Force proceed anyway? (not recommended)
```

### Phase 2 — Source Dissection

```bash
python scripts/analyze.py --source [source_path]
```

**What analyze.py does:**
```
- Extract all import paths + cross-reference with DUDA_MAP → layer tags
- Check hook/store/context usage
- Extract DB queries → verify isolation conditions (tenant identifiers)
- Detect dynamic import / runtime conditional logic patterns
  (import() / require( / role === / process.env)
  → [UNVERIFIABLE] tag + manual verification required
- Check for hardcoded upper-only identifiers
```

Tags assigned to each item:
- `[UPPER-ONLY]` — cannot be transplanted
- `[SHARED]` — safe to reference directly
- `[NEEDS-ADAPTER]` — same interface, separate implementation needed
- `[REBUILD]` — must be reimplemented from scratch
- `[UNVERIFIABLE]` — static analysis impossible, manual review required

### Phase 3 — Trust Score Measurement

```bash
python scripts/trust.py --mode transplant --source [path] --target [path]
```

**4-Axis Measurement:**

```
Map Trust      (×0.20):
  Boundary file checksum match    40pts
  File count unchanged            20pts
  User approval completed         30pts
  Zero ambiguous tags             10pts

Analysis Trust (×0.35):
  Import tagging completion rate  40pts (rate × 40)
  No dynamic logic               20pts (0 if exists + manual check required)
  DB isolation conditions verified 25pts
  UPPER-ONLY handling plan confirmed 15pts

Boundary Trust (×0.30):  ← NO COMPROMISE, 100pts required
  Isolation policy physically exists  40pts
  Destination contamination-free      40pts
  No transplant-deny list conflicts   20pts

Intent Trust   (×0.15):  ← 100pts required
  Source specified              30pts
  Destination specified         30pts
  Scope confirmed               20pts
  User explicitly confirmed     20pts
```

**Verdict:**
```
95~100pts → ✅ Execution permitted
85~94pts  → 🟡 Conditional — list shortfall items + re-check, then proceed
70~84pts  → 🟠 Hold — request user judgment, specify risk items
 ~69pts   → 🔴 Execution denied

On denial, output:
  Overall trust: 71pts (threshold: 95pts)
  Shortfall items:
    Analysis trust 58pts ← 3 dynamic imports unverified
    Boundary trust 60pts ← destination contamination detected
  Resolution order:
    1. Run AUDIT → boundary trust expected +40pts
    2. Manually verify 3 dynamic imports → analysis trust expected +20pts
    Expected after: 91pts → re-measure to proceed
```

### Phase 4 — Strategy Selection (95pts+ only)

Auto-selected based on tag distribution:

| Condition | Strategy |
|-----------|----------|
| All `[SHARED]` | **Strategy 1** — Direct reference |
| `[NEEDS-ADAPTER]` present, shared logic 60%+ | **Strategy 2** — Adapter branching |
| `[REBUILD]` present | **Strategy 3** — Reimplementation |
| `[UPPER-ONLY]` in core, or transplant-deny list match | **Strategy 4** — Transplant denied |

### Phase 5 — Execution

Auto-generate and run strategy-specific Claude Code execution prompts.

Execution rules (always included):
```
- Never copy source files as-is
- Never import [UPPER-ONLY] items in lower layers
- Include tenant identifiers in all DB queries
- Verify isolation policies apply to newly created files
```

### Phase 6 — Map Update + Memory Record

```bash
# Partial map refresh
python scripts/map_update.py --diff

# Record decision to memory for future learning
python scripts/memory.py record \
  --mode TRANSPLANT \
  --source [source_path] \
  --target [target_path] \
  --result '{"strategy": [number], "trust_score": [score], "risk": "[level]"}'
```

Only refresh upstream nodes of changed files. No full re-scan.
Recorded results apply instantly on next identical path request.

---

## AUDIT Mode

### Phase 1 — Symptom Capture

```
Identify:
□ Which layer/screen shows the symptom
□ What shouldn't be exposed (data? functionality? UI?)
□ Which layer's content is incorrectly visible
□ When did it start / after which operation
```

### Phase 2 — Tunnel Tracing

```bash
python scripts/audit.py --symptom "[symptom]" --layer "[layer]"
```

**What audit.py does — isolation-type-specific search:**

```
Type A (Platform-Derivative):
  grep -r "from.*platform/" [lower_layer_path] --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx"
  → Detect upper-only imports in lower layers

Type B (Multi-tenant):
  → Detect DB queries missing tenant identifiers
  → Check for tables without RLS policies

Type C (Monorepo):
  grep -r "from.*apps/" [app_path] --include="*.ts"
  → Detect cross-app direct imports

Type D (Microservice):
  → Detect direct DB access across service boundaries
  → Detect API boundary bypass (direct function calls between services)
```

### Phase 3 — Root Cause Determination

```
A. Isolation policy leak  — queries without tenant identifiers / unapplied policies
B. Component contamination — [UPPER-ONLY] code copy-pasted to lower layer (most common)
C. State contamination     — shared store/context scope not separated
D. Boundary violation      — direct import / direct DB access across boundaries
```

### Phase 4 — Recovery + Map Update + Memory Record

After applying type-specific fixes:

```bash
# Partial map refresh
python scripts/map_update.py --diff

# Record AUDIT result to memory
python scripts/memory.py record \
  --mode AUDIT \
  --source [symptom_path] \
  --result '{"root_cause": "[type]", "contamination_path": "[path]", "fix_applied": true}'
```

If the same contamination pattern recurs, memory provides instant root cause identification.

**AUDIT Output:**
```
## 🔍 DUDA AUDIT

Symptom:          [summary]
Isolation type:   [Type A/B/C/D]
Root cause type:  [A/B/C/D]
Root cause location: [file/policy name]
Contamination path:  [A → B → C]
Impact scope:     [file list]

Fix prompt:
[executable block]

Verification:
□ [auto-generated checklist item 1]
□ [auto-generated checklist item 2]
□ [auto-generated checklist item 3]
```

## Recursive Learning Memory System

> The more you use it, the more it accumulates, and the faster it processes.
> It doesn't re-analyze from scratch — it builds on experience.

### Storage Structure

```
.duda/memory/
├── pattern_db.json    ← TRANSPLANT/AUDIT result pattern learning
│                         Strategy history per source+target combination
├── path_cache.json    ← Path→layer-tag cache
│                         Permanent reuse of flood-fill results
└── decision_log.json  ← Complete decision history
                          Accuracy auto-corrects via feedback
```

### Confidence Growth Path

```
First run    [UNKNOWN]  → Full analysis required
1 experience [LOW]      → Full analysis + reference previous
2 experiences [MEDIUM]  → Quick analysis + compare with cache
3 experiences [HIGH]    → Skip analysis, apply cache immediately  ← acceleration starts
5+ experiences [CERTAIN] → Instant processing, minimal tokens
```

### Accuracy Correction via Feedback

When results are wrong:
```bash
python scripts/memory.py feedback \
  --decision-id d0042 --correct false --note "Strategy 2 was correct"
```
→ Confidence for that pattern auto-downgrades → re-analysis triggered on next run

### Learning Status Check

```bash
python scripts/memory.py stats
```

```
🧠 DUDA Recursive Learning Status
───────────────────────────────
🚀 Acceleration Phase — mostly cache hits

Path cache:    347 entries
  CERTAIN:    89
  HIGH:      142

Pattern DB:    38 entries
  Avg hits:   4.2

Decision log:  156 entries
  Cache hit rate: 71.2%
  Processing speedup: 3.8x
```

## Manual Mode (No Python Required)

When Python is not available, DUDA guides you through manual analysis.

### Manual INIT
1. List all import statements:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "from\|import" --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" src/
   ```
2. Identify leaf files (files that don't import from your project — only external packages)
3. Tag each file based on its imports:
   - References only `packages/` or external → `[SHARED]`
   - References `platform/`, `admin/`, `system/` paths → `[UPPER-ONLY]`
   - References specific layer paths → `[LAYER:X]`
4. Create `DUDA_MAP.md` with the tagging results
5. Identify boundary files (layout.tsx, middleware.ts, route.ts) and note their layer

### Manual TRANSPLANT
1. List all imports in the source file
2. For each import, determine the layer tag (SHARED/UPPER-ONLY/NEEDS-ADAPTER)
3. Check DB queries for tenant identifier (`org_id`, `tenant_id`, etc.)
4. If any `[UPPER-ONLY]` → cannot transplant directly, use adapter or deny
5. If all `[SHARED]` → safe to reference from packages/

### Manual AUDIT
1. Identify the symptom layer and what's incorrectly visible
2. Search for cross-layer imports:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "from.*platform\|from.*system\|from.*admin" src/tenant/ --include="*.ts"
   ```
3. Search for DB queries missing tenant filter:
   ```bash
   grep -rn "\.from(" src/ --include="*.ts" | grep -v "org_id\|tenant_id"
   ```
4. Trace the contamination path from root cause to symptom

---

## Core Principles

```
1. No DUDA_MAP → INIT first
2. Migration keyword detected → confirm intent → no code touched until 95-point trust
3. Copy-first approach is structurally blocked
4. [UPPER-ONLY] items are never imported in lower layers
5. Unknown segments are marked [UNVERIFIABLE] — never filled by guessing
6. After every operation: partial map refresh + memory record
7. Self-reinforcing: map precision and memory depth grow with each use
```
